There are two python files in total: functions_class.py and class_results.py and can be run by python 3.functions_class.py contains functions and methods. This file gives no output after running. functions_class.py needs to be run before using class_results.py.class_results.py contain validations of implemented functions and attempts to the main tasks. It is important to have run the first and second cell before running any other cell, which imports functions from libraries and functions_class.py, while the second cell imports the data and creates the object that is later used throughout the rest of this file.For each question, in class_results.py, it is important to run in the order of cells and cells by cells. For example, one needs to run ‘3.2 Fit function’ before running ‘3.3 Likelihood function’. It is also fine to just run the whole class_results.py after running the functions_class.py.To look at the graphs, it is also important to enlarge the graph to avoid overlapping of axes and titles.
